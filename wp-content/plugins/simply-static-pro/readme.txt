Simply Static Pro enhances Simply Static with awesome features like Forms, GitHub integration and comments.

== Description ==

Simply Static Pro is an addon for the quite popular Simply Static Plugin and enhances it with various features.

= Forms =

Currently supported are Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms. You can use the integrated webhook or use external services to receive the form submits and send you an e-mail.

= Comments =

Simply Static Pro can handle comment submission on your static site with webhooks.

= GitHub Integration =

Simply Static Pro integrates with GitHub. It creates and maintains a repository for you that you can use to deploy your website to one of the various
static site hosters like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages.

= Builds =

Builds allow you to only export single pages or a subset of pages instead of doing a full static export every time.

= Search =

Simply Static Pro uses Fuse.js and creates a fully static index of your website. It provides a shortcode called [ssp-search] that renders a search bar with auto-suggest.
It's completely independed from any third-party services.
